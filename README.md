# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the app with npm run dev.
Access the password generator through your web browser and start creating secure passwords instantly.
Feel free to contribute, report issues, or customize the app according to your needs. Stay secure online with this powerful password generator!
